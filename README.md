# Vaccum
My Vaccum is an agent that will change its decision according to the environment. For some decision, it is hard to make. 
If you have any bugs that you have seen, please let me know so that I can improve it. 

Run it
1. First clone the project. 
2. compile the main.cpp file with the Makefile in the repository with the command "make"
3. After the compile, a agent execute file should be created. 
4. make driver and agent execute ( chomd 755 ) and then do " ./driver agent" in the terminal

Note
with the command, the map should be randomly generated and then agent will response to the agent accordingly. But for some steps, 
it does take longer to calcuate and predict.
